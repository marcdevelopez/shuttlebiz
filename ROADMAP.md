---

## 📊 **Risk Assessment & Mitigation**

### **High Risk Items:**

- **Real-time sync complexity** → Prototype early, implement conflict resolution
- **Phone verification costs** → Monitor usage, implement rate limiting
- **User adoption challenge** → Start with closed beta in target communities

### **Technical Risks:**

- **Concurrent booking conflicts** → Implement optimistic locking
- **Push notification reliability** → Fallback to in-app notifications
- **Offline data conflicts** → Clear conflict resolution UX
