## 🎯 **Success Metrics & KPIs**

### **Technical Goals:**

- App startup time < 3 seconds
- 95%+ crash-free sessions
- Real-time updates < 2 second latency
- Core features work offline

### **Business Goals:**

- 50+ active groups in first 3 months
- 80%+ onboarding completion rate
- 60%+ user retention (month 1)
- Average booking time < 2 minutes

---

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Core Stack:**

- **Frontend:** Flutter 3.x + Riverpod + GoRouter
- **Backend:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Functions, FCM)
- **Development:** GitHub + GitHub Actions CI/CD

### **Key Design Decisions:**

- **Mobile-first:** iOS and Android with single codebase
- **Real-time:** Firestore streams for live updates
- **Offline-capable:** Local data caching with sync
- **Scalable:** Cloud-based with automatic scaling

---

## 📊 **Risk Assessment & Mitigation**

### **High Risk Items:**

- **Real-time sync complexity** → Prototype early, implement conflict resolution
- **Phone verification costs** → Monitor usage, implement rate limiting
- **User adoption challenge** → Start with closed beta in target communities

### **Technical Risks:**

- **Concurrent booking conflicts** → Implement optimistic locking
- **Push notification reliability** → Fallback to in-app notifications
- **Offline data conflicts** → Clear conflict resolution UX

---

## 🔄 **Project Management Evolution**

### **Current Phase: GitHub Issues + Projects**

- Perfect for 2-person team and MVP development
- Integrated with code repository
- Simple workflow and low overhead

### **Future Scaling (when team grows to 5+):**
