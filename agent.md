# Agent Instructions (Codex)

Purpose: keep a lightweight checklist so Codex consistently logs meaningful project changes in `docs/dev_log.md` with your approval.

- Before editing `docs/dev_log.md`, propose the exact entry and ask for your explicit OK. Do not modify the dev log without approval.
- Always confirm the real current date with the user before drafting a dev log entry or updating "Última actualización"; do not assume based on prior sessions.
- When a change/decision/problem/roadmap milestone occurs, draft a dev log update in the existing format (date/day, “Trabajo realizado”, “Decisiones”, “Problemas”, “Próximos pasos”) matching the current project day.
- If nothing is worth logging, confirm with you that no dev log update is needed.
- Keep entries concise, factual, and aligned with the established tone/structure of `docs/dev_log.md`.
- Never overwrite or remove existing log content unless you explicitly request it; append new entries chronologically.

Reminder to Codex: at the end of each session where work was done, ask if you should draft a dev log update and show the proposed text before writing it.
