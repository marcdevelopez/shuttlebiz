# ShuttleBiz APP

**ShuttleBiz** is a new mobile application concept designed to address a very specific need in the shared transportation space:

While many apps help people travel from point A to point B, ShuttleBiz focuses on **bringing together groups of people with a shared purpose**—such as employees from the same company or participants of a common event—and helping them coordinate rides in a shuttle provided either by themselves or by their organization.

The platform aims to include **real-time group chat**, **live GPS tracking**, and a **seat reservation system** to improve efficiency, communication, and overall usefulness.

> This project is currently in its **early planning and design phase**, focused on gathering requirements, creating initial wireframes, and exploring technical feasibility using Flutter and Firebase.

This is not just another ride-sharing app—ShuttleBiz is being built with **coordinated group transport** in mind, offering new possibilities for organizations and communities.
